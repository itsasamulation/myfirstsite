<h2>Designing for Minds in the Digital Age</h2>
        <p><strong>Hi, I'm Samantha - A digital technology researcher and UX/UI designer blending psychology, sociology, and technology to build empathetic and meaningful digital experiences.</strong></p>
        <p>I’m passionate about the intersection of design and human behavior. With a background in psychology and sociology, I create user-centered digital experiences that are not only functional but also support well-being. <br>From accessibility to cyberpsychology, my work is driven by a deep curiosity about how technology shapes our lives—and how we can shape it for the better.</p>
<br>
<h2>Vision, Values, and Approach</h2>
        <h3>Building a Safer, Smarter Digital Future</h3>
        <p>My work goes beyond creating interfaces—it’s about advocating for a digital world that prioritizes mental health, inclusivity, and ethical design. Whether through thoughtful UX strategies or contributing to safer online environments, I strive to create meaningful change in how we experience technology.</p>
        <h3>Where Science Meets Design</h3>
            <p>
                My design philosophy is rooted in research and empathy. Drawing on principles of psychology and cyberpsychology, I aim to create digital spaces that are:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User-Centered:</strong> Focused on real human needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Empathetic:</strong>Designed with inclusivity and accessibilty in mind.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safe:</strong>Advocating for ethical design and healthier online experiences.</li>
                </ul> 
            </p>
