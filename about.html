                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Samantha—an Experience Design Specialist with a passion for crafting digital experiences that make life easier and more enjoyable. My background in sociology and psychology from UBC, paired with my UX/UI associate certificate studies at BCIT, gives me a unique perspective on how people think, behave, and interact with technology.

                <h3><a name="design-approach">My approach to design</a></h3>
                <p>
                    At the heart of my work is empathy. I believe great design starts with understanding users—what they need, how they feel, and what barriers stand in their way. Whether it’s usability testing, information architecture, or interface design, I’m committed to creating solutions that are accessible, intuitive, and meaningful. My design philosophy centers on collaboration, ensuring that every project balances user needs with business goals. 
                </p>
                <h3><a name="beyond">Beyond design</a></h3>
                <p>
                    My curiosity extends beyond UX/UI into the broader relationship between psychology and technology. I’m fascinated by how digital tools shape behavior, and I maintain a <a href="https://samanthadadd.substack.com" target="_blank">Substack</a> where I write about topics like cyberpsychology and digital well-being. 
                    <br><br>
                    This passion fuels my design work, inspiring me to build solutions that not only solve problems but also have a positive impact on people’s lives.
                 </p>
                 <h3><a name="ahead">Looking ahead</a></h3> 
                 <p>
                    My short-term goals include mastering HTML and expanding my technical skills while contributing to impactful projects in my current role. <br><br>
                    My long-term goal is to pursue graduate studies in cyberpsychology, where I hope to explore the intersection of technology, behavior, and mental health. I aspire to play a meaningful role in shaping the next generation of empathetic digital spaces, where design prioritizes inclusivity, accessibility, and well-being.
                 </p>

When I’m not designing, you’ll find me gardening on my Vancouver balcony, baking something sweet, or working to improve my 5k running pace.
